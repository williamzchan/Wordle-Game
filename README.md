# Wordle-Game

This is a replication of the game Wordle in JAVA. If you don't know what Wordle it was a word/puzzle type of game that was popular in early to mid 2022. 
The game gives users to guess a 5-letter work in 5 guesses.
If the letter in the guess is present in the correct word then either the letter will light up in green or yellow. Green meaning the letter in the 
guessed word shares a letter in the exact spot in the correct word. Yellow meaning the correct word has the same letter in the guessed word but it is in the 
incorrect position.
